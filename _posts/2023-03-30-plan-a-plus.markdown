Have you ever heard the advice to always have a plan B in case your plan A fails? Well, I'm here to tell you that this advice is not always helpful. In fact, sometimes having a plan B can actually sabotage your plan A and prevent you from achieving your goals.

How so? Because having a plan B implies that you are not fully committed to your plan A. It means that you are already anticipating failure and preparing for it. It means that you are not willing to take the necessary risks and sacrifices to make your plan A work. It means that you are settling for less than what you really want.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you should never have a backup plan for anything in life. There are some situations where having a plan B is prudent and sensible, such as when you are dealing with unpredictable factors or emergencies. But there are also some situations where having a plan B is detrimental and limiting, such as when you are pursuing your dreams or passions.

In those cases, having a plan B can distract you from your plan A. It can make you lose focus and motivation. It can make you compromise and lower your standards. It can make you give up too easily and miss out on opportunities. It can make you doubt yourself and your abilities.

Instead of having a plan B, I suggest that you have a plan A+ instead. A plan A+ is a plan that is so compelling and exciting that you don't need a plan B. A plan A+ is a plan that aligns with your values and purpose. A plan A+ is a plan that challenges you and inspires you. A plan A+ is a plan that makes you happy and fulfilled.

To have a plan A+, you need to be clear about what you want and why you want it. You need to be passionate and enthusiastic about it. You need to be confident and optimistic about it. You need to be persistent and resilient about it. You need to be willing to do whatever it takes to make it happen.

Having a plan A+ does not mean that you will never face difficulties or failures. It does not mean that everything will go smoothly and perfectly. It does not mean that you will not have to adapt or change along the way. But it does mean that you will not let anything stop you from pursuing your vision. It does mean that you will not settle for anything less than your best. It does mean that you will enjoy the journey as much as the destination.

So, the next time someone tells you to have a plan B, ask yourself if you really need one. Maybe what you really need is a plan A+. And maybe what you really need is to ditch your plan B and go all in with your plan A.
